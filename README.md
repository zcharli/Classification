# Classification
In this project, we explore different techniques of deterministic classification to evaluate data sets 
gathered form the UCI machine learning repository. We remploy k-fold and leave on out testing on our results.

We try to classify wines based on liquid chemical composition. Classify iris flowers based on external features. 
Classify heart disease based on patient symptons. 

## Techniques
- Bayes in the form of Naive, Optimal, and Linear classifiers
- Decision trees

## Set up requirements
I recommend getting Scikit-learn at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/, otherwise you may look to install each dependency through pip

Everything is written with Python 2.7.X, so it would be good to have that.

Run comment/uncomment main.py then simply run.
